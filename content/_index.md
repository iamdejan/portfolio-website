Hello, my name is Giovanni Dejan. I am a software engineer, mainly in backend but currently learning infra as well.

I was first taught of C++ language (as you can see in [my post](https://blog.devgenius.io/your-first-programming-language-76d5a3312eb0) where I shared my first experience in programming), but over the time, I learned Java, Python, and Golang. Currently, I'm learning Kubernetes and Terraform as well.
