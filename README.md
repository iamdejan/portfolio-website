# Portfolio Website

This repo contains the code for my personal portfolio website, that will be hosted on `iamdejan.my.id`.

The website is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a Rust-based static site generator. The theme that I use is [Kodama](https://www.getzola.org/themes/kodama-theme/), with some modifications.

## Warning

DO NOT edit files in `/public` directory. It should be generated by Github Actions everytime there's a push in PR. The reason it needs to be committed is because Cloudflare Pages has [recent problem with Zola](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/zola-build-fails-not-found/535948), so I need to build Zola from Github Actions and push the website assets manually. 

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

1) Zola: install by following [this guide](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
2) NPM: after you install NPM, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Testing

Run `zola serve` on the terminal. You can access the site in `http://localhost:1111`.

### Build

Run `zola build`.
